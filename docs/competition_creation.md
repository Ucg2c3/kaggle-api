# Hosting a Competition from the CLI

This page documents the host-facing commands added in kaggle-cli for the new
public competition-creation API endpoints (kagglesdk 0.1.31+):

- [`kaggle competitions init`](#kaggle-competitions-init)
- [`kaggle competitions create`](#kaggle-competitions-create)
- [`kaggle competitions pages create`](#kaggle-competitions-pages-create)
- [`kaggle competitions launch`](#kaggle-competitions-launch)

All four commands require an authenticated session
(`kaggle config set username/password` or an API token).

A typical end-to-end host workflow looks like:

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a metadata file.
kaggle competitions init ./my-comp

# 2. Edit ./my-comp/competition-metadata.json (fill in the INSERT_* placeholders).

# 3. Create the (unlaunched) competition.
kaggle competitions create -p ./my-comp
# → Competition created: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/my-comp-slug

# 4. Author the description and rules pages.
kaggle competitions pages create my-comp-slug --name description -f ./description.md --publish
kaggle competitions pages create my-comp-slug --name rules -f ./rules.md --publish

# 5. Launch the competition (now, or schedule a future UTC time).
kaggle competitions launch my-comp-slug --at 2027-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

The four commands are independent — for example, you can call `pages create`
on a competition that already exists, or use `launch` on a competition created
via the host wizard.

## `kaggle competitions init`

Writes a `competition-metadata.json` template into a folder.

**Usage:**

```bash
kaggle competitions init [folder]
```

**Arguments:**

- `folder` (optional): Where to write `competition-metadata.json`. Defaults to
  the current directory.

**Example:**

```bash
kaggle competitions init ./my-comp
```

The generated file:

```json
{
  "title": "INSERT_TITLE_HERE",
  "slug": "INSERT_SLUG_HERE",
  "briefDescription": "INSERT_BRIEF_DESCRIPTION_HERE",
  "privacy": "PUBLIC",
  "disableKernels": false,
  "hackathon": false,
  "cloneCompetitionId": null,
  "cloneExcludeCompetitionData": null,
  "clonePageNames": null,
  "licenseId": null,
  "organizationId": null,
  "numPrizes": null,
  "restrictLinkToEmailList": null,
  "reward": null
}
```

See [Metadata reference](#competition-metadata-reference) below for what each
field means.

---

## `kaggle competitions create`

Creates a new competition from `competition-metadata.json`. The competition is
created in an unlaunched (staged) state — use
[`kaggle competitions launch`](#kaggle-competitions-launch) to publish it.

**Usage:**

```bash
kaggle competitions create [-p folder]
```

**Options:**

- `-p, --path <folder>`: Folder containing `competition-metadata.json`. Defaults
  to the current directory.

**Example:**

```bash
kaggle competitions create -p ./my-comp
# → Competition created: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/my-comp-slug
```

**Errors you might see:**

- `Default title detected, please update competition-metadata.json before creating`
  — you forgot to replace one of the `INSERT_*_HERE` placeholders.
- `Invalid privacy '...'` — `privacy` must be one of `PUBLIC`, `LIMITED`, `PRIVATE`.
- `Metadata file not found: competition-metadata.json` — run `init` first, or pass
  `-p` pointing at the folder that contains the file.

### Competition metadata reference

All fields go in `competition-metadata.json` (camelCase keys).

**Required:**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | Display title shown on the competition page. |
| `slug` | string | URL slug; lowercase, hyphens, must be unique site-wide and must not be all digits or all hyphens. |
| `briefDescription` | string | One-line subtitle under the title. |
| `privacy` | string | One of `PUBLIC`, `LIMITED`, `PRIVATE`. |

**Optional:**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `disableKernels` | bool | If `true`, notebook submissions are disabled. |
| `hackathon` | bool | Create as a hackathon competition. |
| `restrictLinkToEmailList` | bool | Restrict invite-link joiners to a host-maintained allowlist. |
| `cloneCompetitionId` | int | If set, clone configuration / pages / data / evaluation setup from this competition. |
| `cloneExcludeCompetitionData` | bool | If cloning, skip copying the data (solution, sandbox submissions, images, databundles). |
| `clonePageNames` | string[] | If cloning, copy only these page names. Omit/null to copy all. |
| `licenseId` | int | License ID for the competition data. |
| `organizationId` | int | Tie this competition to an organization (read-only access for all org members). |
| `numPrizes` | int | Number of leaderboard prize positions. |
| `reward` | object | See below. |

**`reward` object:**

```json
{
  "id": "USD",
  "quantity": 25000,
  "clarification": "Total prize pool split across the top 5 teams."
}
```

`reward.id` is one of: `USD`, `KUDOS`, `AUD`, `EUR`, `JOBS`, `SWAG`, `GBP`,
`KNOWLEDGE`, `PRIZES`. `clarification` is optional free-form text shown next to
the prize.

## `kaggle competitions pages create`

Creates a new page (description, rules, evaluation, data-description, etc.) on a
competition you host.

**Usage:**

```bash
kaggle competitions pages create <competition> --name <page-name> -f <path> \
    [--mime-type <type>] [--post-title "<title>"] [--publish]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<competition>`: The competition slug.

**Options:**

- `--name <page-name>` (required): Page name (e.g. `description`, `rules`,
  `evaluation`, `data-description`, `prizes`). Conventional names are
  recognized by the competition page UI; new names are allowed but won't be
  shown in the standard tabs.
- `-f, --file <path>` (required): Path to a file whose contents become the page
  body.
- `--mime-type <type>` (optional): MIME type of the content. Defaults to
  `text/html` server-side.
- `--post-title "<title>"` (optional): Title shown above the page body.
  Defaults to the page name.
- `--publish` (optional): Publish the page immediately. Without this flag the
  page is created in a staged (unpublished) state so you can review it before
  going live.

**Example:**

```bash
# Stage a draft of the rules page.
kaggle competitions pages create my-comp --name rules -f ./rules.md \
    --mime-type text/markdown --post-title "Competition Rules"

# Replace with a published version once you're happy.
kaggle competitions pages create my-comp --name rules -f ./rules-final.md --publish
```

**Note:** `pages create` does not update an existing page in place — it creates
a new page. Use [`kaggle competitions pages delete`](#kaggle-competitions-pages-delete)
to remove a page.

You can list and inspect existing pages with `kaggle competitions pages`
(or the explicit `kaggle competitions pages list`).

---

## `kaggle competitions pages delete`

Deletes a page from a competition you host. Prompts for confirmation unless
`-y/--yes` is passed (matches the existing `kaggle datasets delete` /
`kaggle kernels delete` patterns).

**Usage:**

```bash
kaggle competitions pages delete <competition> --page-name <name> [-y]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<competition>`: The competition slug.

**Options:**

- `--page-name <name>` (required): Name of the page to delete.
- `-y, --yes` (optional): Skip the confirmation prompt — useful for scripts.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive: prompts "Are you sure you want to delete the page 'faq' ...?"
kaggle competitions pages delete my-comp --page-name faq

# Scripted: skip the prompt.
kaggle competitions pages delete my-comp --page-name faq -y
```

**Note:** a small set of pages is protected by the backend and cannot be
deleted; attempting to delete one returns an error from the server.

Deletion is not recoverable — there is no "undelete". List pages first with
`kaggle competitions pages list <competition>` if you're unsure of the name.

---

## `kaggle competitions launch`

Launches a competition you host. Without `--at`, the competition is launched
immediately. With `--at`, the backend schedules the launch for the given UTC
instant.

**Usage:**

```bash
kaggle competitions launch <competition> [--at <ISO-8601 UTC>]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<competition>`: The competition slug.

**Options:**

- `--at <iso>`: Schedule launch for a future UTC time. Accepts ISO-8601
  (e.g. `2027-01-01T00:00:00Z` or `2027-01-01T00:00:00+00:00`). The competition
  is launched immediately if omitted.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Launch right now.
kaggle competitions launch my-comp

# Schedule the launch for midnight UTC on 2027-01-01.
kaggle competitions launch my-comp --at 2027-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

A competition can only be launched once. Subsequent calls will be rejected by
the backend.
